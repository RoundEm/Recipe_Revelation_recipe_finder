# Summary of App:
This app is a 'reverse recipe finder' that allows users to find popular recipes by searching for specific ingredients, all of which will be included in any successfully returned recipes. This allows users to find meals they can make with ingredients available in their kitchen or just gives them inspiration for different recipes they can make. The app is powered by yummly.com's recipe aggregator, which pulls recipe data from some of the most popular food blogs and recipe sites on the web.
