To Do:
- What happens to Find Recipe button when search is done? Has something to do with results less than 9 or resultResponse variable, also when you go to the last page it seems like you can't get back to the prior page?
- Change hints button text depending on status
- add aria to hints section?
- responsive widths for input and other search section elements
- highlight ingredients when tabbed focus (see GoT project?)

Questions:
- way to make auto-suggestion not show after enterting an ingredient??


Javascript features to add down the road:
- separate clear buttons for ingredient list and returned recipes
- add http to recipe site urls that don't have it or just remove links?
- remove duplicate recipes from the same site
- filter by vegetarian or food allergies
- something showing how many results and how many remaining
