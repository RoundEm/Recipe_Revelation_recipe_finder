page handling goal: if there are less than x number of matches remaining, hide the more results button. 

considerations:
	- displayCounter will use this to know how many results to limit
	- probably do page validation & page number updating after results buttons are selected

players:
	- page counter 
	- resultsPerPage counter
	- resultsLimiter that controls how many times displayRecipeData runs
	- moreResults button
	- lessResults button
	- new function that's called by results button instead of recipeMatchValidation function

things to do sidenote:
	- replace 9 with resultsPerPage variable so the number can be changed from one place
