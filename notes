To Do:
- how to get close icon to highlight when focused

Features to add down the road:
- separate clear buttons for ingredient list and returned recipes
- add http to recipe site urls that don't have it or just remove links?
- remove duplicate recipes from the same site
- filter by vegetarian or food allergies
- something showing how many results are returned and how many remaining
- hide recipe ingredients once section height reaches a certain point
