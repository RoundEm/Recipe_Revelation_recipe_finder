Javascript features to add down the road:
- separate clear buttons for ingredient list and returned recipes
- add http to recipe site urls that don't have it or just remove links?
- remove duplicate recipes from the same site
- filter by vegetarian or food allergies
- something showing how many results and how many remaining
