To Do:
- Sometimes results aren't displayed when they are returned
- Bug when you try to return from the last page of results that causes a URL to not be found (e.g. star anise, bacon, lemon)? / If you go to the last page it seems like you can't get back to the prior page?  
- add aria to hints section?
- check if totalTimeInSeconds is null and if so insert custom message stating that the time isn't known
- decrease width of clear and find labels when full screen

Questions:
- way to make auto-suggestion not show after enterting an ingredient??
- hide clear and submit buttons?


Javascript features to add down the road:
- separate clear buttons for ingredient list and returned recipes
- add http to recipe site urls that don't have it or just remove links?
- remove duplicate recipes from the same site
- filter by vegetarian or food allergies
- something showing how many results are returned and how many remaining
